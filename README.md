gadgetrie
=========

Gadetrie, pronounced "gadgetry", is a simple ROP gadget finder, written in C.
It is small and simple, but complete. It finds all possible gadgets in the
executable segment of a program and shows them to you. It doesn't do anything
fancy like constructing a payload for you, it's just a gadget finder.

It only supports 32-bit ELF binaries.
